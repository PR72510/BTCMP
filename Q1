Block elements are those elemnts that take up whole width on the wwebpage. A block element starts from new line every time it is created.
Eg-Paragraph<p>, Header<h1>, <div>,Form<form>

Inline elements only take up that much width which is required. So new element can also occupy that line.
Eg- Span<span>, Images<img>, Anchors<a>
